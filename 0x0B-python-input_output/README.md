# Python Input/Output Project

This project focuses on Python input/output operations and aims to help you understand various aspects of file handling, cursor manipulation, and JSON serialization/deserialization. The project has specific requirements and learning objectives that you need to fulfill.

## Requirements

- Python Scripts:
  - Editor: Vim
  - Python Version: 3.8.5
  - Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - File Format: Unix-style text file (ending with a new line)
  - Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Code Style: Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
  - Executable Files: All scripts should be executable
  - README.md: A mandatory file explaining the project

- Python Test Cases:
  - Editor: Vim
  - File Format: Unix-style text file (ending with a new line)
  - Test Files: Place all test files in a folder named "tests"
  - Test Execution: Run tests using the command `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
  - Documentation: Include meaningful documentation for modules, classes, and functions
