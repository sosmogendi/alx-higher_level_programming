## Python - Object-relational mapping

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Python - Object-relational mapping" project. In this project, you will bridge the worlds of Python and databases by using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques with SQLAlchemy. The primary focus is to connect Python code with a MySQL database, eliminating the need for direct SQL queries. By the end of this project, you will gain insights into why Python programming is awesome, how to interact with a MySQL database, and the power of ORM.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8.5
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
