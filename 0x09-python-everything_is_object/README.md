# Python - Everything is Object

## Project Overview

This project explores the concept of objects in Python and delves into various aspects related to object behavior, mutability, and references. It aims to enhance your understanding of Python's object-oriented programming paradigm and its unique features.

## Project Objectives

The project consists of tasks and questions that require you to comprehend and analyze Python's object model. It encourages you to think critically, discuss with peers, and apply logical reasoning to arrive at the correct answers. Avoid relying solely on testing examples in the Python interpreter and instead focus on understanding the underlying principles.

## Getting Started

To begin the project, review the provided resources, including the recommended readings. It is crucial to spend time thinking critically and brainstorming with your peers before attempting the tasks. Avoid solely relying on the Python interpreter for answers. Instead, strive to understand the underlying principles and apply logical reasoning to solve the problems.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- Python Scripts: You will create Python scripts to provide solutions for the tasks.
- Text Answer Files: Each task requires a one-line answer, which should be provided in text files.

## Requirements

The project has the following requirements:

- Python Scripts:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
  - Scripts should end with a newline character
  - The first line of each script file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines (use `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*)
  - Ensure all script files are executable

- Text Answer Files:
  - Only one line
  - No shebang
  - Files should end with a newline character
