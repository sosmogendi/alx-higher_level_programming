# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

This project focuses on Python inheritance and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Description

This project explores the concept of inheritance in Python, which allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. By understanding inheritance, you can create class hierarchies, promote code reusability, and organize your code more effectively.

  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5

  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Code should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines
  - All files must be executable
  - Use a README.md file to provide a project overview and instructions
- Python Test Cases:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All test files should end with a new line
  - All test files should be inside a "tests" folder
  - All tests should be executed by using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
