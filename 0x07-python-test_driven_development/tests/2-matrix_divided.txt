# Test case 1: Divide matrix by 2
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
# Expected output: [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

# Test case 2: Divide matrix by 3
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
# Expected output: [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# Test case 3: Invalid matrix (not a list of lists)
>>> matrix = 123
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
# Expected output: TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test case 4: Invalid matrix (rows have different sizes)
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
# Expected output: TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test case 5: Invalid div (not a number)
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 'div')
# Expected output: TypeError: div must be a number

# Test case 6: Division by zero
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
# Expected output: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
