## **Python - Test-driven development**
- This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python, emphasizing the importance of writing tests and documentation before writing actual code.

## Concepts

The project expects you to understand the following concept:

- Never forget a test

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until "26.2.3.7. Warnings" included)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI)
- [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Interactive and Non-interactive tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#interactive-and-non-interactive-tests)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an interactive test is
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What the basic option flags are to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- All your test files should be text files with the extension `.txt`
- All your tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have documentation (execute `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have documentation (execute...)
